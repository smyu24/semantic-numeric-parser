## Air Force Working Capital Fund Budget Overview

## Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 President's Budget (PB)

Increasing lethality and improving readiness to prepare for the high-end fight is a primary objective of the Air Force's FY 2025 President's Budget (PB).  The Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) contributes to Air Force readiness through the depots' skills to sustain the AF's organically maintained weapon systems and logistically manage the supply chain's critical assets.  As a world-class organization, the AFWCF responds rapidly to customer needs on par with private sector defense firms with tremendous flexibility to meet surge requirements.

AFWCF Blue is the portion of the working capital fund the AF manages (see below in Activity Group Overview for additional details),  therefore  does  not  include  Transportation Working  Capital  Fund  (TWCF). AFWCF Blue Cash ended FY 2023 at $1,088.6 million and FY 2024 and FY 2025 are expected to build cash and remain within the upper and lower cash limits, ending FY 2025 with $1,730.8 million.

## Activity Group Overview

The AFWCF Blue conducts business in two primary areas:  the Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group and the Supply Management Activity Group-Retail.  The Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF), for which the Air Force assumed responsibility for cash oversight in FY 1998, is part of this submission.  However, United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), rather than the Air Force, has management responsibility for TWCF's day-to-day operations.

## Air Force Core Strategic Capabilities

In support of Air Force core functions, the AFWCF activities provide maintenance services, weapon system parts, base and medical supplies, and transportation services.  The working capital funds are integral to the readiness and sustainability of our air, space, and cyber assets and our ability to deploy forces worldwide and across any theater to support overseas operations and National Defense Strategy interests.  Maintenance depots provide equipment, skills, and repair services that keep forces operating worldwide.  Supply Management activities procure and manage inventories of consumable and repairable spare parts  that  support  all  the  force  structure  mission-ready.    USTRANSCOM  is  the  single  DoD  manager  for  the  Defense Transportation System (DTS) in peace and war.  Working capital fund activities, directly and indirectly, provide warfighters the critical services needed to meet global mission capability requirements.

## Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group

The Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG) mission is supply management of reparable and consumable items and maintenance services.   CSAG is managed under a Chief Executive Officer structure.  The Air Force Material Command (AFMC) Commander (AFMC/CC) is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  The AFMC Director of Logistics (HQ AFMC/A4) serves as the Chief Operating Officer (COO), and the AFMC Director of Financial Management (HQ AFMC/FM) is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).  The Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC), one of the six centers within AFMC, directs both CSAG divisions' day-to-day operations. The activity operates with two divisions:  Maintenance and Supply.

## Maintenance Division

The CSAG-M repairs weapon systems and spare parts to ensure readiness in peacetime and to provide sustainment for overseas operations.  The division enhances readiness by efficiently and economically repairing, overhauling, and modifying aircraft, engines, missiles, components and software to meet customer demands.  The CSAG-M depots have unique skills and  equipment  required  to  support  and  overhaul  both  new,  complex  components  and  aging  weapon  systems.    During contingencies, the depots can surge repair operations and realign capacity to support the war fighter's immediate needs.

CSAG-M remains a fundamental  element  of  both  readiness  and  sustainability  by  providing  a  cost-effective,  rapid  repair capability. CSAG-M repair and overhaul capabilities are accomplished by one of the six centers within the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) and its Air Logistics Complex (ALC) depots.  The division operates on funds received from its customers through sales of its services.

## Supply Division

The CSAG Supply Division is responsible primarily for Air Force-managed, depot-level reparable spares and consumable spares unique to the Air Force.  Reparable supply items are economically maintained through overhaul or repair.  Consumable supply items are consumed in use or discarded when worn out or broken because they cannot be repaired economically.  In addition to management of these inventories, the CSAG Supply Division provides a wide range of logistics support services including requirements forecasting, item introduction, cataloging, provisioning, procurement, repair, technical support, data management, item disposal, distribution management, and transportation.

The  CSAG  Supply  Division  works  to  reduce  the  impact  of  Diminishing  Manufacturing  Sources  and  Material  Shortages (DMSMS) and other obsolescence issues associated with aging  aircraft fleets.    Due  to  fleet  age  and  utilized  antiquated technology, the number of parts without qualified manufacturing or repair source is expected to continue to be a problem.  To address these DMSMS and other obsolescence issues, the CSAG Supply Division re-engineers parts which can no longer be produced or repaired.  The CSAG Supply Division also proactively identifies parts for which availability is at risk due to DMSMS issues, taking appropriate action to minimize adverse impact to weapon system readiness.

## Supply Management Activity Group-Retail

The  Supply  Management  Activity  Group-Retail  (SMAG-R)  manages  approximately  2.0  million  inventory  items,  including weapon system spare parts, medical-dental supplies and equipment, and other supply items used in non-weapon system applications.  The Air Force SMAG-R is a critical component in combat readiness by procuring materiel and makes spares available to authorized retail customers.  The activity operates with three divisions:  General Support, Medical Dental, and the Air Force Academy.  The Medical Dental Division inventory includes a War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Stockpile.  WRM provides initial warfighting capability until re-supply lines sustain wartime demands for medical and dental supplies and equipment.

The  SMAG-R  provides  a  wide  range  of  logistics  support  services,  including  requirements  forecasting,  item  introduction, cataloging, provisioning, procurement, repair, technical support, data management, item disposal, distribution management, and transportation.    Inventories  are  an  integral  part  of  SMAG-R  and  are  maintained  by  each  of  the  divisions  supporting customer requirements.  The SMAG-R objective is to replenish  stocks and provide supplies to customers  on time within customer funding constraints while maintaining fund solvency.

## Transportation Working Capital Funds

USTRANSCOM's mission includes providing air, land, and sea transportation for the DoD with a primary focus on wartime readiness. USTRANSCOM's $9.6 billion budget provides synchronized transportation and sustainment, making it possible to project and maintain national power where needed, with the greatest speed and agility, the highest efficiency, and the most reliable  level  of  trust  and  accuracy.    The  assigned  Unified  Command  Plan  tasks  are  executed  through  three  component commands  (U.S.  Army's  Military  Surface  Deployment  and  Distribution  Command  (SDDC),  U.S.  Navy's  Military  Sealift Command (MSC), and U.S. Air Force's Air Mobility Command (AMC)) and one major subordinate command (Joint Enabling Capabilities  Command  (JECC)).    This  joint  team  of  transportation  components  provides  mobility  forces  and  assets  for  a seamless transition from peace to war.  USTRANSCOM is always ready to meet the strategic mobility needs of the nation.  A brief description of the role of each Transportation Component Command follows:

AMC is the single manager for air mobility by providing airlift, air refueling, special air mission, and aeromedical evacuation for U.S. forces.  AMC also supplies forces to theater commands to support wartime tasking.

MSC supports the nation by providing marine transportation to satisfy DoD sealift requirements, which includes delivering supplies and conducting specialized missions across the world's oceans.

SDDC provides global surface deployment and distribution services to meet the nation's objectives.

USTRANSCOM's Component Commands provide the critical link to the Services' core competencies in organizing, training, and equipping forces.  They provide lines of communication to the Services, ensuring assets are available when needed for the transition from peace to war.  The surge from peacetime sustainment to a massive deployment of people and material in support  of  Overseas  Operations  is  an  example  of  USTRANSCOM's  ability  to  execute  the  mission.    USTRANSCOM's successes result from the synergy of military and commercial lift (air, land, and sea), air refueling, port operations, and afloat prepositioning - all requiring the team efforts of the Commander's Staff and the components.  Together with its components and national partners, USTRANSCOM is building a truly seamless, end-to-end defense transportation enterprise.

## Air Force Initiatives

AFSC continues to evaluate supply chain and maintenance processes to improve weapon system and equipment availability and to deliver customer support with increased velocity.  Sustained emphasis is on cost control in order to provide the best value to the customer.

AFSC is pursuing alternative manufacturing technologies, additive manufacturing, establishing a reverse engineering and manufacturing  framework  to  rapidly  solve  availability  issues  derived  from  DMSMS,  supply  chain  risk,  and  obsolescence challenges.  They are modernizing spares requirements planning to optimize inventory, and a multitude of other initiatives aimed at streamlining the supply chain process.

AFSC's Maintenance efforts are contributing to Air Force readiness and sustainability by providing a cost-effective, rapid repair capability.  CSAG-M  seeks  to  provide  continuous  core  Air  Force  depot  capability  to  retain  in-house  sources  of  technical competence; to continue to refine methods which enable the more efficient use of resources such as partnering with private industry,  employing  government  owned/contractor  operated  facilities  and  augmenting  in-house  operations;  and  to  find innovative ways to decrease flow days for systems and components, increase parts availability to the repair line, and control material costs through process reviews and adoption of commercial practices and engineering standards.

## Direct Appropriations

In FY 2023, AFWCF received $80.4 million in direct appropriation for Medical Dental WRM requirements. In FY 2024 Air Force requested $83.6 million and in FY 2025 Air Force requests a total of $86.9 million in direct appropriations supporting Medical Dental WRM requirements.

## Cash Management

The 4Rs

<!-- image -->

The methodology for calculating cash requirements consists of four elements: rate, range of operations, risk mitigation, and reserves (all of which are colloquially known the 4Rs in the AFWCF).

AFWCF Overview - FY 2025 President's Budget (PB)

<!-- image -->

The Rate of Disbursements for the AFWCF Blue FY 2025 PB was determined by dividing the total disbursements by the number of expected collection cycles for each division. The AF Blue collection cycles is a weighted average of all divisions rounded to nearest whole number. The weighting is based on the total disbursements.

The Range of Operations is the difference between the lowest and highest planned monthly cash estimate plus one-half of the rate of disbursement at the sub-activity group level. The AF Blue range is the sum of the sub-activity groups range. In FY 2025, the projected rate of disbursement is $733.2 million, and the lower range is $825.1 million. The upper range is $2,239.3 million. The difference between the two ranges results in $1,414.2 million as the basic operating range.

AFWCF Blue Risk mitigation addresses cash variability associated with unknown external variables and both day-to-day and seasonal volatility inherent to AFWCF operations. Historically customer demand is depressed during the first five months of the  Fiscal  Year,  negatively  impacting  cash  balances.  This  demand  is  further  exacerbated  by  external  stressors  such  as continuing resolution authority.  This cyclical phenomenon occurs annually during the beginning of the fiscal year and poses risk of insolvency if limits are set too conservatively. During the last four to five months of the fiscal year customer demand and revenues typically increase to their highest levels. Risk mitigation is critical to AFWCF operations because it buffers low cash during the first five months of the next fiscal year. To mitigate seasonal volatility, we calculated the standard deviation from the mean for four years of historical disbursements data (FY 2020 - FY 2023). One standard deviation for this data is $106.6 million. In a normal distribution 68 percent of all data values lie within one deviation. The standard deviation value used for FY 2025 is based on three standard deviations and encompasses 99 percent of all data values minimizing the execution year risk. The reason three standard deviations were used for FY2025 is to ensure the  cash lower limit is sufficient to pay average amount  disbursed  per  collection  cycle.  This  will  result  in  a  corresponding  decrease  in  cash.  Therefore,  three  standard deviations or $319.8 million is factored in for operational volatility to mitigate risk of insolvency to the fund.

Cash Reserves are held for cash balances that will be paid out in future cycles and late in the current cycle. The first category is Accumulated Operating Results (AOR) returned/recovered to or from customers through annual rates. The second reserve supports unliquidated obligations of the MDD's direct appropriation for WRM. No AOR return is held. The AOR retention for FY 2025 is $454.1 million, and is comprised primarily of GSD, CSAG-S and CSAG-M. The unliquidated appropriation amount for MDD WRM program is $51.1 million.

## THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK

## Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group

## Budget Overview

## Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 President's Budget (PB)

The mission of the Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG) is supply management of reparable and consumable items,  and  maintenance  services.    Reparable  supply  items  are  economically  maintained  through  overhaul  or  repair. Consumable supply items are consumed in use or discarded when worn out or broken because they cannot be repaired economically.  CSAG Maintenance Division (CSAG-M) and Supply Division (CSAG-S) services are executed under the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) within the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) structure described in the Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) Overview.  With supply chain management and depot maintenance functions in one center, AFSC analyzes and develops sustainment-wide procedures, processes, and metrics with the ultimate goal of increasing availability, capability, and affordability.  This construct supports one of the Air Force's distinctive capabilities, Agile Combat Support, providing greater ability to posture for additional workload.  It also preserves the viability of depot maintenance and the supply chain capabilities.

## Maintenance Division

The CSAG-M repairs weapon systems and spare parts to ensure readiness in peacetime and to provide sustainment for overseas operations.  The division enhances readiness by efficiently and economically repairing, overhauling, and modifying aircraft, engines, missiles, components, and software to meet customer demands.  The CSAG-M depots have unique skills and equipment required to support and overhaul both new, complex components and aging weapon systems.  During contingencies, the depots can surge repair operations and realign capacity to support the war fighter's immediate needs.

CSAG-M remains a fundamental element of both readiness and sustainability by providing a cost-effective, rapid repair capability. CSAG-M repair and overhaul capabilities are accomplished by one of the six centers within the AFMC, AFSC and its Air Logistics Complex (ALC) depots.  The division operates on funds received from its customers through sales of its services.

Organic maintenance sites include:

Ogden Air Logistics Complex (OO-ALC), Ogden, Utah Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex (OC-ALC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex (WR-ALC), Warner Robins, Georgia

## Supply Division

CSAG-S is responsible primarily for Air Force-managed, depot-level reparable spares and consumable spares unique to the Air Force.  Reparable supply items are economically maintained through overhaul or repair.  Consumable supply items are consumed in use or discarded when worn out or broken because they cannot be repaired economically.  In addition to management of these inventories, CSAG-S provides a wide range of logistics support services including requirements forecasting,  item  introduction,  cataloging,  provisioning,  procurement,  repair,  technical  support,  data  management,  item disposal, distribution management, and transportation.

CSAG-S works to reduce the impact of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and other obsolescence issues associated with aging aircraft fleets.  Due to fleet age and utilized antiquated technology, the number of parts without qualified manufacturing or repair source is expected to continue to be a problem.  To address these DMSMS and other obsolescence issues, CSAG-S re-engineers parts which can no longer be produced or repaired.  CSAG-S also proactively  identifies  parts  for  which  availability  is  at  risk  due  to  DMSMS  issues,  taking  appropriate  action  to  minimize adverse impact to weapon system readiness.

## CSAG Customer Base

Maintenance and Supply customers include Air Force Major Commands, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve Command, the Army, the Navy, other WCF activities (i.e., Transportation Working Capital Fund), other government agencies, publicprivate partnerships, and foreign countries.  The CSAG divisions also are customers of each other; Maintenance Division repairs  parts for Supply  Division  while  the  Supply  Division  provides  parts that  the  Maintenance  Division  uses in  depot maintenance services.  Continued focus on readiness drives customer orders to both CSAG-M and CSAG-S.

## CSAG Initiatives

Individual processes are being modernized within CSAG.  AFSC continues to evaluate supply chain and maintenance processes to improve weapon system and equipment availability and to deliver customer support with increased velocity. Continual emphasis is on cost control in order to provide the best value to the customer.

AFSC strives to precisely define material requirements with respect to aging aircraft.  Numerous problems exist with aging aircraft, such as first-time failures, loss of suppliers, Diminishing Manufacturing Source and Material Shortages (DMSMS), etc.  To combat the aforementioned DMSMS issues and other supply chain challenges, the Air Force is fostering senior leader engagement through multiple forums:

-  Expanding collaborative forecasting efforts through enhanced deep dive efforts
-  Expanding market research and source development capabilities,
-  Continually engaging with Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and Air Force Contracting to streamline the purchase instrument process,
-  Participating in DMSMS working groups charged with identifying critical obsolescence issues.
-  Placing greater focus on current and proposed future technology trends
-  Continuous  monitoring  for  obsolescence/end  of  life  alerts  and  strategically  placed  obsolescence  mitigation opportunities

AFSC  is  pursuing  alternative  manufacturing  technologies,  additive  manufacturing  and  establishment  of  a  reverse engineering and manufacturing framework to rapidly solve availability issues derived from DMSMS, supply chain risk and obsolescence  challenges.    It  is  modernizing  spares  requirements  planning  to  optimize  inventory  and  implementing  a multitude of other initiatives aimed at streamlining the supply chain process.

AFSC's Maintenance efforts are contributing to Air Force readiness and sustainability by providing a cost-effective, rapid repair capability. CSAG-M seeks to provide continuous core Air Force depot capability to retain in-house sources of technical competence; to continue to refine methods which enable the more efficient use of resources such as partnering with private industry,  employing  government  owned/contractor  operated  facilities  and  augmenting  in-house  operations;  and  to  find

innovative ways to decrease flow days for systems and components, increase parts availability to the repair line, and control material costs through process reviews and adoption of commercial practices and engineering standards.

## Supply Management Activity Group - Retail

## Budget Overview

## Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 President's Budget (PB)

The  Air  Force  Supply  Management  Activity  Group-Retail  (SMAG-R)  is  comprised  of  three  divisions:  General  Support Division (GSD), Medical-Dental Division (MDD), and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). SMAG-R manages ~2.0 million inventory items including weapon system spare parts, medical-dental supplies and equipment, and other items used in non-weapon system applications. SMAG-R is a critical component in the support of combat readiness. It procures materiel and makes spares available to authorized customers. Within SMAG-R, MDD inventory includes a War Reserve Material (WRM) Stockpile.

SMAG-R  provides  a  wide  range  of  logistics  support  services  including  requirements  forecasting,  item  introduction, cataloging, provisioning, procurement, repair, technical support, data management, item disposal, distribution management and transportation. Inventories are an integral part of SMAG-R and are maintained by each of the divisions in support of customer requirements. The SMAG-R objective is to replenish inventories and provide supplies to customers in a timely manner within customer funding constraints, while maintaining fund solvency.

## Division Overviews

GSD finances the Air Force retail inventory and issues requirements for all non-Air Force managed economic order quantity (EOQ) items other than those pertaining to peculiar medical, commissary, and fuels requirements. GSD items support installation,  maintenance,  administrative  functions,  field  and  depot  maintenance  of  aircraft,  ground  and  airborne communication and electronic systems, and other sophisticated systems and equipment. Also included is initial outfitting of individual clothing items issued to new recruits, organizational clothing items such as firemen's protective over garments, 'clean room' coveralls, air crew helmets, and chemical biological warfare protective over garments. This retail activity is accomplished at 233 Air Force installations throughout the world.

USAFA finances the purchase of uniforms, uniform accessories, and miscellaneous commodities required by USAFA cadets during their four-year stay at the Academy. The customer base consists of approximately 4,000 cadets. USAFA

procures both distinctive uniforms and accessories from various manufacturing contractors and regular Air Force uniforms purchased through the Defense Logistics Agency.

The Surgeon General of the Air Force is responsible for the overall management of MDD. Nearly all peacetime customer orders come from Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) funded by the Defense Health Program (DHP) appropriation.

In addition to the peacetime program, MDD is also responsible for purchasing and maintaining the inventory/assets funded by WRM appropriation. The medical WRM inventory is owned by MDD until it is needed for war fighter deployment or contingency operations, and it is then sold to the AF line and funds are collected. WRM inventory accounts for approximately 96% of total MDD inventory at any given time.

## WRM / Direct Appropriation

MDD's WRM provides supplies and equipment vital to support forces in the full range of military operations for the first 30 days of a contingency operation and provides force health protection materiel to all deploying Air Force Active, Reserve, and Guard personnel. Availability of this materiel ensures Air Force personnel can deploy as scheduled and the contingency operations can be conducted until re-supply lines are established and materiel is routinely received from the contiguous United States. A direct appropriation funds the establishment and sustainment of over 3,300 assemblages and Force Health Protection assets for 255 locations that are maintained in MDD until required to provide direct support to the war fighters.

Approximately one third of WRM pharmaceuticals must be replaced annually because of shelf life or emergence of newer, more effective treatments. Sustainment costs to replace expiring materiel will continue to increase due to additional Unit Type Codes (UTCs) fielded into the WRM inventory, increased number of consumable items with expiration dates and manufacturers reducing the shelf life as new products enter the market.  Medical equipment requires constant upgrade to maintain  the  medical  standard  of  care  for  required  deployable  capability.  New  technology  allows  for  replacement  of equipment  with  smaller,  more  proficient  models  which  often  drives  a  change  in  other  supply  requirements.  Periodic modernization  of  WRM  ensures  clinical  and  operational  relevance  of  the  UTC  based  on  changes  in  clinical  practice guidelines, medical technology, threat and operational environment and operational maneuver concepts.

## SMAG-R Retail Customer Base

SMAG-R generates revenue from sales of various supplies to a diverse customer base.  Primary SMAG-R customers are Air Force Major Commands (including Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard), Foreign Military Sales, Army, Navy, Defense Health Program, non-DoD activities, and other working capital activities, such as Air Force Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group-Maintenance Division.

## SMAG-Retail Financial and Performance Summary

The table on the next page provides revenue and expense data for the SMAG-R division. Revenue and expenses in FY 2023 reflect an Accumulated Operating Result (AOR) of $769.3 million and primarily due to GSD. Expenses increase primarily driven by GSD projected workload in FY 2024 and FY 2025 in Flying Hour Program (FHP) and increasing inflation factors. Revenue increase is consistent with increasing price change and customer requirements.  Expense and Revenue changes for USAFA and MDD are stable and in line with current customer requirements and historical data. SMAG-R AOR declines by $24.8 million in FY 2024 and by $108.1 million in FY 2025 as GSD returns profits ending with a deferred AOR of $636.4 million. The deferred AOR reduces insolvency risk in GSD and the AFWCF overall and allows the program to preserve cash.

Projected FY 2024 Unit Cost Rate (UCR) for SMAG-R is 1.01, and FY 2025 UCR is 1.02, slightly above normal 1.0 goals due to GSD deferred AOR.

The WRM direct appropriation received is included in the Total Revenue and Expenses balances in all fiscal years. Other Adjustments (WRM) are completed so Net Operating Result (NOR) reflect only results associated with the Operating Program, keeping WRM Program activity NOR neutral.

| Upper Range Target | $1,102.1  | $903.8    | $915.9    |

The FY 2023 SMAG-R ending cash balance increased as collections from the Depots were received. FY 2024 and FY 2025 decreases primarily driven by GSD returning profits through negative NOR. The lower operating range is driven by the GSD deferred AOR.

## Background

This submission provides justification for the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) budget.  USTRANSCOM submits the TWCF budget as a distinct subset of the Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) budget submission.  It reflects the cost authority needed to meet USTRANSCOM's Unified Command Plan (UCP) mission. With global responsibilities and capabilities that transcend air, land, and sea, USTRANSCOM is uniquely postured to fulfill six specific responsibilities within the current UCP that include: 1) the Mobility Joint Force Provider, 2) the Department of Defense (DoD's) Single Manager for Transportation, 3) the Joint Deployment and Distribution Coordinator (JDDC) for the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), 4) the DoD's Single Manager for Patient Movement, 5) the provider for Joint Enabling Capabilities via the Joint Enabling Capabilities Command (JECC) (JECC is not part of the Working Capital Fund), and 6) the DoD's Single Manager for Global Bulk Fuel Management and Delivery.

USTRANSCOM and the broader JDDE are designed to project and sustain combat power at a time and place of the Nation's choosing. The success of  DoD's power projection capability is contingent on three critical elements of  USTRANSCOM's organizational warfighting framework: (1) Global Mobility Posture, the foundation of power projection; (2) Global Mobility Capacity, the conveyances and platforms that move troops, supplies, fuel, and equipment through global transportation networks; and (3) Global Command, Control, and Integration, the exercise of authority and direction to plan, coordinate, synchronize, and control operations at echelon.

From day-to-day operations through wartime mobilization, commercial nodes, rail infrastructure, trucks, aviation, and sealift capabilities are integral to USTRANSCOM's ability to respond and scale to need. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) details the Department's path forward into a decisive decade - from helping to protect the American people, to promoting global security, to seizing new strategic opportunities, and realizing and defending our democratic values.

The Nation relies on USTRANSCOM to project an immediate and decisive force when needed and continues to adapt to the most complex security environment in recent history. USTRANSCOM provides our Nation's leaders with various options while presenting multiple offensive alternatives to thwart potential adversarial activities.

## Composition of Component Business Areas

USTRANSCOM's mission includes providing air, land, and sea transportation for the DoD with a primary focus on wartime readiness. Our $9.6 billion budget provides synchronized transportation and sustainment, making it possible to project and maintain national power where needed, with the greatest speed and agility, the highest efficiency, and the most reliable level of trust and accuracy.  Our assigned UCP tasks are executed through three component commands U.S. Army's Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC), and U.S. Air Force's Air Mobility Command (AMC) and one major subordinate command (JECC).  This joint team of transportation components provides mobility forces and assets for a seamless transition from peace to war.  USTRANSCOM is always ready to meet the strategic mobility needs of our nation.  A brief description of the role of each Transportation Component Command follows:

## United States Transportation Command Transportation Working Capital Fund Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Budget Analysis

AMC is the single manager for air mobility by providing strategic airlift, air refueling, special air mission, and aeromedical evacuation for U.S. forces. AMC also supplies forces to theater commands to support wartime tasking.

MSC supports our nation by providing maritime transportation to satisfy DoD sealift requirements, which includes delivering supplies and conducting specialized missions across the world's oceans.

SDDC provides global surface deployment and distribution services to meet the nation's objectives.

Our Component Commands provide the critical link to the Services' core competencies in organizing, training, and equipping forces.  They provide lines of  communication  to  the  Services,  ensuring  assets  are  available  when  needed  for  the  transition  from  peace  to  war.    The  surge  from  peacetime sustainment to a massive deployment of people and material in support of overseas operations is an example of our ability to execute our mission.  Our successes result from the synergy of military and commercial lift (air, land, and sea), air refueling, port operations, and afloat prepositioning.  Together with its components and national partners, USTRANSCOM is building a truly seamless, end-to-end defense transportation enterprise.

Despite concerted efforts to improve financial transparency and reporting, USTRANSCOM has received six audit disclaimers of opinion. During fiscal year 2023, USTRANSCOM conducted an end to end review of TWCF and accounting operations to understand issues impacting remediation efforts. This analysis lead to a revised audit strategy across USTRANSCOM and the components.

Global Bulk Fuel Management and Delivery (GBFMD) - Section 352, FY2022, National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) designated USTRANSCOM as the element responsible for bulk fuel management and delivery of the (DoD) on a global basis, beginning on 1 February 2023 and costs are incorporated in this submission.

USTRANSCOM  is  committed  to  improving  the  relocation  process  for  military  members  and  families.  In  support  of  the  DoD  reform  initiative, USTRANSCOM transitioned the Defense Personal Property Program (DP3) to a centralized acquisition approach with a single move manager.  By transitioning to a single move manager, Global Household Goods Contract (GHC) fundamentally restructures DoD's relationship with the household goods moving industry to deliver the quality that service members, DoD employees, and their families deserve, and the accountability that Congress demanded.

Capital  funding  continues  to  support  system  enhancements  and  upgrades  to  embrace  USTRANSCOM's  role  as  a  global  Combatant  Command delivering national objectives in tomorrow's dynamic security environment.  USTRANSCOM challenges its assumptions, accurately forecasts trends that  will  define  the  future  operating  environment  and  develops  the  technologies  and  ideas  that  maintain  our  Nation's  competitive  advantage  in transportation and logistics. Cyber resiliency and digital modernization initiatives will remain a top priority for the command.  We continue to modernize our IT systems by not only taking advantage of cloud computing services but also through advancing our ability to manage data as a strategic asset to advance decision making at all levels.

Revenue:  Revenue estimates include rate revenue, reimbursable revenue, Airlift Readiness Account, and Service Level Bills.  They are determined as follows:

-  Rate revenue: Derived by using approved rates multiplied by various workload measures (i.e., flying hours, ton miles, tons, passengers, ship days, measurement tons, vehicles, etc.). In most cases, TWCF rates recoup budgeted costs and beginning Accumulated Operating Results (AOR), consistent with standard Working Capital Fund guidelines.
-  Reimbursable revenue: Includes commercial airlift and sealift charters purchased by customers (charged based on recovery of contract costs).
-  Airlift Readiness Account (ARA):  As directed in the DoD FMR, AMC's channel airlift rates are set to compete with private sector rates and do not cover the cost of the unique readiness requirements of military airlift operations.  The ARA recoups the difference between channel system operating costs and benchmarked rate revenue, plus/minus prior year channel losses/gains.  Starting in FY 2024, charter rates are established to recover 100% of the cost of military charters and no longer impacts the ARA.
-  Service Level Bills (SLB): Port Readiness, Traffic Management and Global Bulk Fuel Management and Delivery.
-  Transactional Bill: Defense Personal Property Program (DP3).

## Cash Management

The methodology for calculating cash requirements consists of four elements: rate, range, risk mitigation, and reserves (colloquially, the 4Rs).

<!-- image -->

FY 2025 Rate of Disbursements is  the  TWCF's average amount disbursed per collection cycle. Range of Operations is  the  highest and lowest expected cash level with $732 million as the basic operating range. Risk Mitigation includes Contingency/Humanitarian Operations, current events, potential emerging 'operational threats', and support of initial unplanned operations until collections begin.  Cash Reserves include Liability Reserves (cost of possible contract termination and carrier bankruptcy) and Continuity of Combatant Command (COCOM) Operations (Continuing Resolution Authority, government shutdown, sequestration).

## Summary of Cash Flows

FY 2023 had $346 million cash flow.  The balance sheet A/R activity decreased $144 million, A/P decrease $14 million, and offset from a positive $255 million NOR.

FY 2024 projects a negative $494 million cash flow.  The balance sheet A/R activity increases $141 million, A/P increases $176 million, and offset from a negative $535 million NOR.

## Capital Investment Program (CIP)

The CIP budget enables USTRANSCOM to build, adapt and maintain the Equipment, Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE), Telecommunications Equipment, Software Development, and Minor Construction required to conduct globally integrated mobility operations, lead the broader Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE), and provide enabling capabilities to project and sustain the Joint Force in support of national objectives.

USTRANSCOM continues to challenge assumptions, accurately forecast trends that will define the future operating environment and develop the technologies to maintain our Nation's competitive advantage in transportation and logistics. Current efforts include Consolidate Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS), Defense Personal Property System (DPS), and Integrated Booking System (IBS).

-  CAMPS continues the agile acquisition approach to ongoing development and modernization of Airlift Requirements, Airlift Planning, Barrel Master, Iterative Planning, Enterprise Service Integration, and Mission Scheduling Service.
-  DPS continues to define, develop, test, and deploy capabilities using agile software methodology for the MilMove prototype. Work continues as this program demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of a significant number of CONUS household moves.
-  IBS continues to transform into an agile suite of business services replacing the legacy system.  The development includes migrating to the cloud with a process-model driven application. This will significantly reduce time to deliver system change requests and expedite solutions to meet user requirements, while also implementing new rates to support the Universal Service Contract 9 (USC9) and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba Contracts.
-  Multiple programs are transitioning to a cloud environment and include the cost of shifting applications and big data to a cloud environment.

## Narrative Justification:

## Description

This capability represents an array of capital equipment investment requirements that aligns with the overall Air Force strategic objectives for sustaining depot facilities and equipment.  Projects are in direct support of Aircraft, Missiles, Engines, Exchangeable, or Other Depot mission.  WSS investments are designed, scheduled, and installed in accordance with established Air Logistics Complex or Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group processes and priorities.  WSS projects support the maintenance mission requirements to sustain the existing organic industrial base, save dollars through increased productivity, and support customer requirements. The equipment, when replaced, upgraded, integrated, or combined into depot industrial operations, leads to efficiency and personnel safety; supports hazardous waste minimization and pollution prevention efforts; enhances product quality; and increases customer satisfaction in performing the Air Force mission.  Time sensitivity of projects to accommodate new or emerging workload capability and produce an acceptable end state is a critical factor in depot operations.  As such, programming and execution in this capability is essential as equipment requirements may change.  Documentation and project justification support are certified and maintained on file in accordance with the established guidance. $6M has been allocated for  Temporary Fabric Hangars (WSS) to accompany the ramp expansion to support the B-52 re-engine efforts.

## Economic Analysis

An Economic Analysis was completed and is on file. EA Waiver has been obtained for the Ramp Expansion (Minor Con) and Temporary Fabric Hangars (WSS).

## Impact

Upgrades are critical to maintaining system reliability and improving operating performance and ensuring the supportability of depot maintenance systems and equipment. New operating system will improve CSAG Maintenance Division's capability to actively monitor and make corrective actions in financial and operational performance.  Support network infrastructure upgrades must be placed into service prior to upgrading operating systems. The Air Force will be unable to track financial, operational and equipment performance without planned infrastructure replacement and improvement. Lack of investments in this capability will impact the depot's ability to effectively monitor performance which results in cost increases, negative inpacts to production, and reduction in aircraft availability for the warfighter.

## Narrative Justification:

## Description

This category includes an array of minor construction projects that allows flexibility in adapting to new and changing workloads.  Projects are smaller in scale (costing between $250,000 and $6,000,000) and are designed, scheduled, and constructed in accordance with Air Logistic Complexes' established priorities.  These projects support the depot maintenance, mission requirements, correct safety and health problems; improve productivity through quality of life improvement projects, improve depot flow days and support office and work space reorganizations.  In addition, MC projects provide construction required to install needed mission essential equipment and capital investment equipment. $5M of Minor Construction has been allocated for the concrete Ramp Expansion to accompany the Temporary Fabric Hangars (WSS) to support the B-52 re-engine efforts.

## Economic Analysis

An Economic Analysis was completed and is on file. EA waiver was obtained for the Ramp Expansion (MC) and temporary Fabric Hangars (WSS).

## Impact

If facilities are not properly maintained or modernized based upon required depot workload, there will be work stoppages along with safety and security issues which affects weapon system availability. The minor construction that is required for new equipment setup will not be in place, thus severely impacting the depots' ability to efficiently provide repair services and meet warfighter requirements. The B-52 fleet will undergo a major modernization effort in conjunction with PDM starting in FY25 requiring additional dock space at OC-ALC.  Current dock and ramp constraints are inadequate to support B-52 modernization efforts stressing the need for an expansion of the Ramp (Minor Construction) and the procurement of temporary Fabric Hangars (WSS).

## Narrative Justification:

## Description

This capability provides for development and acquisition of both operating and application software that supports Fixed Asset and Supply capabilities as related to the 'Acquire to Retire' and 'Plan to Stock' business processes, respectively, associated with Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul - Supply (MRO-S) depot operations. Software requirements include systems programs, application programs, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software, independent subroutines, databases, equipment upgrades, Test Program Sets (TPS) and software documentation. System application software may be acquired through: (1) the purchase of a COTS system; (2) the development of new applications through either internal development (in-house) or contractual effort; or (3) the modernization of existing software that significantly expands and/or enhances its existing capabilities. Fixed Asset and Supply capabilities are related to the 'Acquire to Retire' and 'Plan to Stock' business processes, respectively, associated with MRO-S.

## Economic Analysis

This requirement has been formally waived by HQ AFMC/FM based on previous higher level authority approval of this effort as well as related efforts in accordance with DoD FMR Volume 2b, Chapter 9, Section 1.5.14.9.

## Impact

Planned software upgrades are critical to maintaining continuous visibility for supply management as well as real-time decisions regarding efficient and effective supply chain management due to changing conditions not only from the field but from within the supply wings themselves.  The changes made to existing systems will allow successful implementation of more efficient maintenance concepts to effectively utilize the Air Logistics Complexes' resources.  Efficiencies critical for long-term success will not be realized if projects remain unfunded.

## Narrative Justification:

## Description

AMP is an end-to-end modeling and simulation environment which supports joint collaborative programmatic analysis, planning execution analysis, experimental planning, execution analysis and peacetime operations. It allows mobility analysts to provide multi-level detailed analyses to support DoD mobility analytical studies. AMP serves as a platform to support futuristic programmatic studies and analyses such as mobility requirements studies and quadrennial defense reviews; it also has implications for component and Combatant Command planners and area of responsibility Directors of Mobility Forces. The current shortcomings in the AMP modeling and simulation capabilities include a lack of efficient communication between models and heuristic based optimization. Air Refueling Model supports the AMP's ability to provide realistic scenarios to evaluate Operational Plans and to gauge risk to the mission due to gaps or seams in logistics support. The primary purpose of ARM is to model the impact of Air Refueling operations in the context of large, programmatic scenarios to determine the number of tankers required to support defense planning scenarios and impact of tanker operations.

## Mission Benefits

This modeling and simulation federation provides integrated, authoritative modeling, simulation, stochastic optimization, and analysis tools for effective and efficient warfighter power projection and sustained long range planning. Modeling enhancements of Intermodal Operations, Ammunition Distribution, Inland Waterways Routing, Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant (POL) terminals, and improved routing schedule will support DoD's analytic agenda for current and future programmatic studies. These modeling enhancements will provide greater insight and modeling detail in evaluating deployment and distribution resource requirements to support National Command Authority (NCA) planning initiatives. These benefits directly support the combatant commands, director of mobility forces, and mobility planners. Increased fidelity of the programmatic analysis modeling capability providing highly reliable and detailed decisionsupport information to enable senior departmental leadership in making informed decisions for mobility and distribution capabilities in supporting the national military strategy.

## Deliverables

Sustainment of current capabilities along with Design and Development of new capabilities as referenced in current year PWS

## Economic Analysis

TCJ8-PC-262-001-Addendum 1 Signed 5 Oct 2017.  Economic Analysis will be updated with Addendum 2 to incorporate changes since last update.  An addendum for Airlift 2.0 was completed dated April 2016.

## Impact

Without this investment, United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) will be unable to provide a Modeling and Simulation environment of interoperable, collaborative models and execution systems capable of providing accurate and consistent answers at the required breadth and depth of the Defense Transportation System (DTS) problem space. Without this investment, the integration of essential elements of analysis into a homogeneous, seamless, all-inclusive environment that ultimately represents the JDDE to the most effective and efficient level of fidelity possible is negatively impacted.

## Narrative Justification:

## Description

Development of MilMove is critical to transitioning capability to the optimal environment to lessen sustainment costs of the current infrastructure. MILMOVE provides 24-hour access connecting service members and civilians to their TSP and transportation office as they are moving their house hold goods in accordance with their permanent change of station orders. MilMove is the key government system supporting the Global Household Goods Contract (GHC) by interfacing and passing key data to the GHC system. MilMove help on-board military members and the invoicing processes led USTRANSCOM to continue the MilMove prototype into the GHC prime's system while also generating the task order for government approval to authorize the GHC prime to perform the HHGs move. The MilMove system will support the GHC prime's invoicing by generating an invoicing request based on the services provided with supporting documentation for the Third Party Payment System to pay the GHC prime.

## Mission Benefits

Multi year development time and transition to increment 4 is essential to ensure uninterrupted support of permanent change of station moves in all DoD components.

## Deliverables

Contract deliverables include all software, release documentation, and system and security documents to be delivered at the completion of each sprint (software release).

## Economic Analysis

The DPS Economic Analysis, certified July 2018, recommended the continued development of a personal property prototype (Alternative 2).  This alternative is less expensive than the Status Quo of continuing to maintain and develop the current legacy DPS Increment 3 system because Increment 4 provides significantly more qualitative benefits in customer support, scalability, security, compliance, and productivity improvements  leading to the most favorable cost to benefit ratio.

## Impact

Delay sunset of Inc. 3, which increases overall costs and risks of system failure and disruption of permanent change of station support.

The IBS consists of the following applications: Carrier Analysis and Rate Evaluation Headquarters (CARE HQ), Carrier Analysis and Rate Evaluation Service Application (CARE SA), Requirements Forecasting and Rate Evaluation (RF-RAM), UNIT, Sustainment (SUS), Commercial Sealift Solutions (CSS), Ocean Carrier Interface (OCI), One-Time-Only (OTO), Advance Transportation Control and Movement Document (ATCMD) and Electronic Shipper System (ESS) IBS-T: Vessel Schedule (VS), Fleet Management (FM), Port Point Of Contact (PPOC), Reference Data (RD). These applications provide automated tool support for the following: carrier contract requirement definition, rate and service solicitations, and evaluation; input vessel schedules; booking unit and sustainment cargo; produce shipment documentation; provide cargo offering and status information; provide payment information and provide In Transit Visibility (ITV) information.

## Mission Benefits

IBS supports Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command's (SDDC) global surface deployment command &amp; control and distribution mission by providing automated tools to support rapid, effective and efficient projections of power CONUS and OCONUS. IBS provides end-to-end distribution and visibility of DOD cargo from time of request until payment to the ocean carrier for services provided. IBS ensures the most cost effective routing of cargo is utilized while ensuring the war fighter receives his cargo on time and cargo preference laws are met. IBS provides tools for carrier contract requirement definition; rate and service solicitations and evaluation; capture vessel schedules; book unit and sustainment cargo; produce shipment documentation; provide cargo offering and event status information; and produce payment information. IBS provides high-level data quality edits with instantaneous in-the-clear error messages and utilizes Electronic Commerce and Electronic Data Interchange standards.SDDC's  Transportation Enhanced Access Management Service web portal provides DOD transportation officials with a single sign-on capability to access IBS for their transportation needs.

## Deliverables

Support cargo booking in the payment process and meet the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness; Decompose booking capabilities into decoupled information and application services to support Enterprise re-use; Implementation of Ocean transportation contracts and contractual obligations to support the Universal Service Contract 9 and Guantanamo Bay Cuba contracts.

## Economic Analysis

Certified 15 Jun 10.

## Impact

If not funded, IBS will be unable to support United States Transportation Command's and SDDC's mission to provide efficient and cost effective projection of forces;  nor provide improved end-to-end joint deployment and distribution.  Specifically, maintenance, new software development and sealift requirement processing will terminate.  Without commercial contract support, IBS will not be able to function and DOD ocean cargo movement would not be supported by an automated system.  In addition, pricing and processing of electronic carrier feeds will no longer maintain valid information requiring manual payment intervention by SDDC booking offices.

## Narrative Justification:

## Description

USTRANSCOM Local Area Network (LAN) a critical system supporting the Command and Control (C2) communications of the USTRANSCOM Commander and staff. It is comprised of ~ 6000 distinct personal computers, numerous servers and routers, a multitude of switches, and the hardware and software infrastructure comprising the classified and unclassified LANs at the USTRANSCOM command site on Scott AFB, IL. This program supports the following activities: Upgrade of network infrastructure to support increasing bandwidth, service, systems and reliability requirements. Server upgrades, network router and switch upgrades, cable installation, network component upgrades, and wide area network connectivity with component commands. Upgrade of standard server Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) products. Provides worldwide Joint Deployment and Distribution Environment (JDDE) theater-centric Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4) infrastructure baseline assessments, engineering and documentation. Provides hardware and system installation support. Provides studio and portable Video Teleconferencing (VTC) technical upgrade support. Provides Audio Visual (AV) presentation system technical upgrade support. Based on the outcome of the review, funding may require future adjustments.

## Mission Benefits

The USTRANSCOM networks are comprised of classified and unclassified Local Area Network (LAN) segments and Wide Area Network (WAN) connectivity with transportation component commands (TCCs).  USTRANSCOM LAN provides the critical backbone for the entire USTRANSCOM C2 capability. This critical infrastructure directly supports the 70+ C2 mission systems that are inherent with USTRANSCOM, providing a global picture for CCMDs on global logistical and patient movements.

## Deliverables

End-of-Life technical refresh that includes Secret Internet Protocol Router Network switches, Adaptive Security Appliance Virtual Private Network (VPN) devices that combined firewall, antivirus, intrusion prevention, and VPN capabilities; Upgrade USTRANSCOM Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) infrastructure; Renewal of network infrastructure hardware maintenance that includes upgrading the Joint Enabling Capability Command infrastructure and Enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol (ECVOIP); Network support to 5500 workstations, 3 computing sites and 30 communications room; Backbone switching of the TC-CENET; Classified routing, VPN devices, OOB networks to securely transmit information.

## Economic Analysis

## N/A.

## Impact

The interruption of capabilities would lead to rapid degradation of Command and Control for all aspects of the JDDE. Gaps in reporting data would immediately affect the Commanders decision cycle, crippling the ability of USTRANSCOM to accomplish its mission of managing Department of Defense transportation assets. We would also lose the redundancy that we have built into the USTRANSCOM LAN to diminish any mission impact.

## Narrative Justification:

## Description

TFMS must comply with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller (OUSD C) directive to become operational with the US Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service G-Invoicing solution for Intragovernmental (IGT) General Terms and Conditions (GT&amp;C) Buy/Sell transactions, Direct Treasury Disbursing, and Procure to Pay (P2P) handshake standardization.

## Mission Benefits

The G-Invoicing platform provides a streamlined capability for processing and approving the GT&amp;C, Order, Performance, and Funds Settlement tasks that occur as part of the IGT Buy/Sell lifecycle. The G-Invoicing solution supports standardized interagency agreement and transaction exchanges between the Requesting/Ordering (Buyer) and the Servicing/Performing (Seller) Agencies. Federal Intragovernmental Data Standards (FIDS) are utilized for conducting all IGT Buy/Sell actions. The Department of Defense's (DoD's) Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA) establishes a blueprint for the Department's business processes, data exchanges, and systems with the intent to maximize efficiency and interoperability throughout the processes. One of these processes, called Procure-to-Pay (P2P), details the steps to procure items, starting with a defined requirement, through contracting and vendor payment. Implementation of the P2P Handshakes will allow data traceability for procurement actions, to include tracking of funding and execution data; reduce or eliminate unmatched financial transactions within the DoD enterprise; ensure that committed funds are sufficient for, and traceable to, the specific line items within an award; support DoD Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness goals; and create efficiencies within the P2P environment. Transitioning to a single, Federal shared service solution under Treasury to perform all disbursement and collection will assist DoD in achieving auditability and sustainability for federal agencies Fund Balance With Treasury (FBWT).

## Deliverables

Automation of G-Invoicing Servicing Agency capabilities and migration of existing orders into the G-Invoicing platform to meet mandated requirements; implementation of GInvoicing Servicing Agency functionality for TFMS Ocean and Port Handling Lines of Business (TAC); integration of required data exchanges to meet OUSD directives; and utilization of the appropriate P2P PRDS and PDS standard handshakes to send and receive data exchanges with the Contract Order Writing System for Purchase Request and Commitment, Pre-Award Funds Validation, Procurement Award, Procurement Modification, and Procurement Close Out Notification data exchanges.
